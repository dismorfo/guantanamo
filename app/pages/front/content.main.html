  <p>Following the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, the United States imprisoned more than seven hundred and
    fifty men at its naval base at Guantánamo Bay, Cuba. These men, who came from over forty different countries, were
    detained without charges, trial, or a fair hearing. Denied any legal status or protection, they were truly outside
    the law: imprisoned in secret, denied communication with their families, and subjected to extreme isolation,
    physical and mental abuse, and, in some instances, torture.</p>
  <p>These are the detainees’ stories, told by their lawyers because the prisoners themselves were silenced. It took
    habeas counsel more than two years—and a ruling from the United States Supreme Court—to gain the right to visit and
    talk to their clients at Guantánamo. Even then, lawyers were forced to operate under severe restrictions designed to
    inhibit communication and envelop the prison in secrecy. In time, however, lawyers were able to meet with their
    clients and help bring the truth about Guantánamo to the world.</p>
  <p>Mark Denbeaux and Jonathan Hafetz—themselves lawyers for detainees—collected stories that describe the experience
    of those confined at Guantánamo and the litigation it sparked. </p>
  <p>The full text of the lawyers' narratives are freely available here for research, teaching, and non-commercial uses,
    and will be preserved as a historical record of these events.</p>
  <p>Denbeaux and Hafetz have edited a book based on many of these narratives, <a
      href="https://nyupress.org/9780814785058/the-guantanamo-lawyers/">The Guantánamo Lawyers: Inside
      a Prison Outside the Law</a>, available from NYU Press.</p>

  <p>Mark Denbeaux is a professor at Seton Hall Law School, where he also directs the Center for Policy and Research.
